                Like Shri Ram College of Commerce, its infrastructure has a vivid history, reflective of its growth and evolution as an institution. In its early days when the College was still known as the Commercial College (till <em>1951</em>), the institution functioned from a hired bungalow situated at 8, Darya Ganj, New Delhi.
           In <strong>1949</strong>, The Delhi Improvement Trust allotted land for the construction of the college building in North Campus. Spread over sixteen acres of land, the now iconic brick red and white structure was conceived by architect Shri G. C. Sharma. The construction of the College began in the following year, in <strong>1950, </strong>with the construction of six staff quarters. This was followed by the commencement of construction of the Main College Building as a single structure in <strong>1951</strong>. The construction was completed in <strong>1954</strong>, and on January 31 of the same year, <strong>Dr. S. Radhakrishnan</strong>, the then Vice- President of India, inaugurated the distinctive Main Building, beginning a new era in the annals of the Institution.</div>
